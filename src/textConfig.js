Being around you feels like walking next to a glowing bright sun warm, happy, and just radiating love everywhere (which is why i chose sun from sun/moon xD). You make everything feel lighter. You care for me in this safe, comforting, very-you way, and every time I’m with you I feel like I suddenly have extra love and affection to give the world just because you exist.

Yeah the name "Prisha" does suit you ngl. 

You’re actual magic. A total rockstar. My panda 🐼.
And I’m so, so lucky to have you ❤️

Thank you for being you. I hope this made you smile, even if it was just a little (but hopefully a lot).
Wish you are veryyyyy happpyyyy christmas baby!`,
